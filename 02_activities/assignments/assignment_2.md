# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
 Good Visualtization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marc.reid/viz/SouthKorea-Demographics/SouthKoreaPopulationDensityandDemographics
-Visually appealing and easy to understand and read
-Even without reading the heatmap is very self explanatory and easy to understand that it's conveying the population density
-Clear context and proper visualizations to represent it, proper lables and annotations
-Offers valuable data driven insights for the message it is trying to convey
-Provides sources for fact checking

Bad Visualization :https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jasonmchlee/viz/WorldDemographicsAnalysis_15816519177900/WorldDemographics

-The message this visualization is trying to get across is unclear, there isn't enough clarity
-The visualization is quite slow, it goes from 1960 to 2013 but it plays at a rate where the audience is sure to get bored
-The pace of the visualization also keeps it from making a real point about the graph and what it is meant to convey, no clear context
-The axis for fertility rate is not self explanatory, what do these numbers mean? What is it trying to convey by comparing life expectancy with fertility rate
-The legend provides the color coding for continets, but the data has all the countries in it. As such is it not easy to differentiate
 between separate countries in a particular geographical location
-History shows all the data from 1960-2013 in one figure, no but there is no context for what it might mean, there is no clear indication of what the audience is 
supposed to understand from it, and it looks very messy and confusing.
-No sources, no way to know what this data is and where it comes from



      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Good Visualization
- One particular graph, the female and male life expectancy one could benefit from tight layout, the label is not entirely visible
- Adding some interactive elements in the heat map might make it more engaing

Bad Visualization
-Provide proper context for the visualization, what is the message, the story? who is it intended for? what is the audience supposed to take back from it?
-Provide better legend and annotations. 
-Explain what the fertility rate is and how it is relevant in this context. 
-Fix the pace of the visualization and possibly choose a different style depending on what the author is trying to convey 







      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
